Data Scientist (0001)
======================================================
We are seeking a data scientist to aid in the development of a new analysis platform 
for nuclear non-proliferation. Broadly speaking, nuclear non-proliferation seeks to
keep nuclear weapons away from people who shouldn't have them. 

This position will help architect and implement an computational platform that will 
consume data from a variety of real data sources (such as satellite imagery and remote 
detectors) and synthesized or simulated surrogate data sources. Consumed data should 
be automatically verified and fed into various mechanisms for quantifying uncertainty.
Real time processing of consumed data is highly-desirable.

Specific area of work will be tailored to applicant and applicants interests.

**Applicant must be eligible for U.S. national security clearance.** 

Please send CV or resume to Prof. Scopatz at scopatz@gmail.com.
