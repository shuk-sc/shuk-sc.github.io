Machine Learning Researcher (0002)
======================================================
We are seeking a machine learning researcher to aid in the development of a new analysis 
platform for nuclear non-proliferation. Broadly speaking, nuclear non-proliferation seeks
to keep nuclear weapons away from people who shouldn't have them. 

This position will help develop and implement new machine learning and/or deep learning
algorithms for uncertainty quantification of non-proliferation data.  This data may 
stem from a variety of real and simulated sources. 
Real time algorithms to validate and interpret incoming data are highly-desirable.

As a research position, the primary goal of the applicant will be to write 
publications demonstrating the results of interesting and new investigations.

Specific area of work will be tailored to applicant and applicants interests.

**Applicant must be eligible for U.S. national security clearance.** 

Please send CV or resume to Prof. Scopatz at scopatz@gmail.com.
