Scientific Software Researcher (0003)
======================================================
We are seeking a scientific software researcher to aid in the development of a new
tool for solving differential equations through compiling optimized symbolic expressions.
Such a tool has the potential to impact many fields, though the first areas of 
research will likely be within nuclear engineering, astronomy and astrophysics, and
molecular dynamics.

This position will require the use and/or development of 
`SymPy <http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>`_. Knowledge of compilers, common 
sub-expression elimination, and computer architecture is highly desirable. 
A major challenges in this area is the high-memory usage of current tools.
Applicants should be interested or able to develop open source communities as 
well as codes. 

As a research position, the primary goal of the applicant will be to write 
publications demonstrating the results of interesting and new investigations.

Please send CV or resume to Prof. Scopatz at scopatz@gmail.com.
